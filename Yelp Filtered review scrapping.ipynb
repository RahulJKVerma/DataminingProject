Ken was very helpful, knowledgeable and immediately diagnosed that the problem was not on the line going to the street but rather the main line to the house.  He fed the motorized snake in and got the clog out at almost 40ft!  Ken suggested we test all showers, faucets and toilets to make sure they were all draining properly and we are happy to say he fixed the issue!  The cleanup was no fun but the fact that Do it RIght came out asap and got the problem fixed the same day was fantastic.

The cornbread and appetizers set the mood for all the wonderful food that followed. I had the Prime rib which was out of this world along with the creamy style horseradish that had exactly the right flavor- not too hot and not too sweet. My companion had the Yard Bird chicken that I was able to get a taste of and I\\'m glad I did, it will be on the top of my list when we return.\\n\\nThe service was fast and the wait staff was friendly. Its refreshing to see people who are happy at what they are doing and it shows as everyone had a smile and was quick to serve and even give information about the \"Q-lounge\" and dance floor.\\n\\nI\\'m excited about getting back over there the very first chance I get to try some of that BBQ chicken and perhaps some ribs to go with it. The home style baked beans were a real treat and the thank \"Q\" sugary sweet donuts were a sweet and happy ending.\\n\\nThank you Bobby Q, I will be back real soon.',\n",
